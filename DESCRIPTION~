Title: An R package for the analysis of stable matchings
Author: Thilo Klein
Maintainer: Thilo Klein <thilo@klein.co.uk>
Description: This package implements a structural estimator to correct for the
    sample selection bias from observed outcomes in matching markets. It also
    contains R code for matching algorithms such as the deferred-acceptance
    algorithm for college admissions, the top-trading-cycles algorithm for
    house allocation and a partitioning linear program for the roommates
    problem.
