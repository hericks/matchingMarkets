<meta property="og:title" content="An R package for the analysis of stable matchings. — matchingMarkets-package" />

<meta property="og:description" content="The matchingMarkets package contains R, C++ and Java code for stable matching 
  algorithms and the estimation of structural models that correct for the sample selection bias of 
  observed outcomes in matching markets.
Matching is concerned with who transacts with whom, and how. For example, who 
  works at which job, which students go to which school, who forms a workgroup 
  with whom, and so on.
The empirical analysis of matching markets is naturally subject to sample 
  selection problems. If agents match assortatively on characteristics 
  unobserved to the analyst but correlated with both the exogenous variable and 
  the outcome of interest, regression estimates will generally be biased.
The matchingMarkets package comprises
Bayes estimators. The estimators implemented in function stabit 
  and stabit2 correct for the selection bias from endogenous matching.
The current package version provides solutions for two commonly observed matching 
  processes: 
  (i) the group formation problem with fixed group sizes and
  (ii) the college admissions problem.
  These processes determine which matches are observed -- 
  and which are not -- and this is a sample selection problem.
Post-estimation tools. Setting mfx=TRUE in the summary function  
  computes marginal effects from coefficients in binary outcome and selection equations 
  and khb implements the Karlson-Holm-Breen test for confounding due to sample selection.
Design matrix generation. The estimators are based on independent variables for all feasible, 
  i.e., observed and counterfactual, matches in the market. Generating the characteristics
  of all feasible matches from individual-level data is a combinatorial problem. 
  The package returns design matrices based on pre-specified transformations to generate counterfactual matches.
Algorithms. The package also contains matching 
  algorithms that can be used to simulated matching data: hri: A constraint model (Posser, 2014) 
  for the stable marriage and 
  college admissions problem, a.k.a. hospital/residents 
  problem (see Gale and Shapley, 1962). sri: A constraint model for the 
  stable roommates problem (see Gusfield and
  Irving, 1989). ttc: The top-trading-cycles algorithm for the 
  housing market problem. These can be used to obtain
  stable matchings from simulated or real preference data (see Shapley and Scarf, 1974).
Data. In addition to the baac00 dataset from borrowing groups in Thailands largest agricultural lending program, the package provides functions stabsim and stabsim2 to simulate one's own data from one-sided and two-sided matching markets.

    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="frequently-asked-questions"><a class="anchor" href="#frequently-asked-questions"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <p></p><ul>
<li><p><em>Why can I not use the classic Heckman correction?</em></p>
<p>Estimators such as the Heckman (1979) correction (in package <a href='https://cran.r-project.org/package=sampleSelection'><code>sampleSelection</code></a>) or double selection models are 
        inappropriate for this class of selection problems. To see this, note that 
        a simple first stage discrete choice model assumes that an observed match 
        reveals match partners' preferences over each other. In a matching market, 
        however, agents can only choose from the set of partners who would be 
        willing to form a match with them and we do not observe the players' 
        relevant choice sets.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Do I need an instrumental variable to estimate the model?</em></p>
<p>Short answer: No. Long answer: The characteristics of other agents in the 
        market serve as the source of exogenous variation necessary to identify 
        the model. The identifying exclusion restriction is that characteristics 
        of all agents in the market affect the matching, i.e., who matches with 
        whom, but it is only the characteristics of the match partners that affect 
        the outcome of a particular match once it is formed. No additional instruments 
        are required for identification (Sorensen, 2007).</p></li>
<li><p><em>What are the main assumptions underlying the estimator?</em></p>
<p>The approach has certain limitations rooted in its restrictive economic assumptions.</p><ol>
<li><p>The matching models are <em>complete information</em> models. That is, agents are assumed to have a complete knowledge of the qualities of other market participants.</p></li>
<li><p>The models are <em>static equilibrium</em> models. This implies that (i) the observed matching must be an equilibrium, i.e., no two agents would prefer to leave their current partners in order to form a new match (definition of pairwise stability), and (ii) the equilibrium must be unique for the likelihood function of the model to be well defined (Bresnahan and Reiss, 1991).</p></li>
<li><p>Uniqueness results can be obtained in two ways. First, as is common in the industrial organization literature, by imposing suitable <em>preference restrictions</em>. A suitable restriction on agents' preferences that guarantees a unique equilibrium is alignment (Pycia, 2012). In a group formation model, (pairwise) preference alignment states that any two agents who belong to the same groups must prefer the same group over the other. Second, by choosing a <em>market assigment</em> based on matching algorithms that produce a unique stable matching, such as the well-studied Gale and Shapley (1962) deferred acceptance algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the models assume <em>bivariate normality</em> of the errors in selection and outcome equation. If that assumption fails, the estimator is generally inconsistent and can provide misleading inference in small samples.</p></li>
